The ApeSDK is a series of simulations that work together. It is primarily written in C and can be built with Mac, Window, Linux and iOS GUIs.

### History

The ApeSDK was started in 1996. Since then it has been under continuous open source development.

* From 2003-2009, it was used by Apple. 
* From 2005-2011, it was used by Intel.

### Simulations Combined

The ApeSDK features a number of simulation components:

* a detailed landscape simulation,
* a rich biological simulation,
* a complex weather simulation, and,
* scaling from a landscape to a planetary simulation (Simulated Earth).

Three levels of social simulation including:

* a reactive simulation,
* a language simulation representing external and internal conversations with a number of actors, and,
* a social factor simulation.

The SDK also features a full-stack scripting language and a series of low-level features bringing it up-to-date with every expected feature of contemporary simulation:

* JSON IO data core,
* multi-platform graphics for Mac, iOS, Windows and Linux,
* a web server for remote viewing and interaction, and,
* frequency and time based audio IO.

### Built with the ApeSDK

The ApeSDK is currently used in:

* **[Simulated Ape](https://gitlab.com/barbalet/simulatedape/)** - a detailed simulation app for Mac and Windows (formerly known as *Nervana* and *Noble Ape*),

* **ApeSim** - an exploratory iOS app based on a UI-stripped-down version of *Simulated Ape*,

* **Simulated Earth** - a detailed planet simulation,

* **Just Plain Chaos** - a skirmish war-game testing for the podcast, *My Rules Are Better*,

* **[Simulated Urban](https://https://gitlab.com/barbalet/urban/)** - a detailed urban environment simulation with the organic agents interacting through a cityscape,

* **[London1940.org](https://london1940.org)** - London in 1940 with No Chance of Invasion.
