Per minute an ape can move at most (39 * 840) / 512 ape units per minute. Let's maintain some decimals for context 63.984375 ape units per minute.

In ape units the map is 16384 units wide and high. If traveling straight over flat land at maximum possible speed it would take the ape 256 minutes to cross the landscape at maximum speed. Which is very rare as most of the apes travel around half that speed or less. 512 minutes to cross the landscape.

Assume 10 km/h for long distance running being equal to roughly 48 ape units per minute. 2880 ape units equal roughly 10 km. The landscape dimensions are rough 56.8km by 56.8km.

NOTE: We should increase the number of possible speeds from 0-39 to a finer grain resolution too. Maybe also making each step equal to some meaningful number of ape units rather than the strange fraction (840 / 512).

Each ape unit is equal to roughly 3.472 mtrs by 3.472 mtrs which seems a little large. (Metres are spelt meters in the US - I'm sure it is punitive).

This is a project, people. If we can resolve the simulation units to metric units it would save all this hand-waving calculation. It all comes down to the ape's speed.
