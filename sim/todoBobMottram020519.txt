Projects discussed with Bob Mottram:

Add 1000 words spoken phonemes to the simulation.

Programmable notion of beauty.

Regional terms referencing places.

JSON server originally written in C then perhaps node.js with a Noble Ape Client.

Notions of grooming in the city - what do some of the Noble Ape primate skills become.

The newspapers from the Mushroom Boy creating political narrative.

Ghosts as a representation of dark age religion.

Abstracting the components:
	Noble Being -> Noble Ape, 
	Noble Being -> Noble Schmuck, 
	Noble Being -> Fierce Feline,
	Noble Being -> Noble Ghost

Meaning in language being imprecise. Just as much about happy agreement of someone talking than meaning.
