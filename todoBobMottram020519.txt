Projects discussed with Bob Mottram:

Add 1000 words spoken phonemes to the simulation.

Programmable notion of beauty.

Regional terms referencing places.

JSON server originally written in C then perhaps node.js with a Simulated Ape Client.

Notions of grooming in the city - what do some of the Simulated Ape primate skills become.

The newspapers from the Mushroom Boy creating political narrative.

Ghosts as a representation of dark age religion.

Abstracting the components:
	Simulated Being -> Simulated Ape, 
	Simulated Being -> Simulated Schmuck, 
	Simulated Being -> Fierce Feline,
	Simulated Being -> Simulated Ghost

Meaning in language being imprecise. Just as much about happy agreement of someone talking than meaning.
