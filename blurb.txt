The ApeSDK was started in 1996. Since then it has been under continuous open source development.

From 2003-2009, it was used by Apple. From 2005-2011, it was used by Intel.

Perhaps most interesting is that most iterations of the ApeSDK have run for hundreds of days and continue to show the same evolutionary complexity and stability.

The ApeSDK features a number of simulation components:

Detailed landscape simulation,
Rich biological simulation,
Complex weather simulation, and,
Scaling from a landscape to a planetary simulation.

Three levels of social simulation including:

a reactive simulation,
a language simulation representing external and internal conversations with a number of actors, and,
a social factor simulation,

The SDK also features a full-stack scripting language and a series of low-level features bringing it up-to-date with every expected feature of contemporary simulation:

JSON IO data core,
Multi-platform graphics for Mac, iOS, Windows and Linux,
Web server for remove viewing and interaction, and,
Frequency and time based audio IO.

The ApeSDK is currently used in:

Simulated Ape - a detailed simulation app for Mac and Windows,
ApeSim - an exploratory iOS app,
Simulated Urban - a detailed urban environment simulation with the organic Ape agents interacting through a cityscape, and,
Simulated War - a pitched battle simulation.
